An exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States is performed.


## Overview

In this project, an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States is performed. The system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC are compared. The differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users are also analysed. 

## Description 

The project is completely done in Jupyter Notebook, using Python 3 and matplotlib for visualizations. A notebook kernel is provided by Udacity and it has all the information required for the completion of the project. It also contains questions and several blocks of code that guide the analysis of the data.
